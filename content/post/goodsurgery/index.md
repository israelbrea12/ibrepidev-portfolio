## Project description:
The GoodSurgery project consists of the development of a mobile application on Android, created to assist patients undergoing colorectal surgery. This application was created with the aim of improving the patient's experience during the entire perioperative process, from the preparation phase to recovery. Created by Israel Brea Piñero in collaboration with the Virgen del Rocío Hospital in Seville.

## What is GoodSurgery?
GoodSurgery is a tool designed to provide clear and detailed information about colorectal surgical procedures. It offers patients a comprehensive guide, accessible at any time, to help them understand the surgical process and the care required both before and after surgery. The application includes sections dedicated to anaesthesia, pre-operative preparation, instructions for the day of admission, and post-operative care, adapted according to the type of intervention.

## Why was it created?
The idea for this application arose from the need to improve communication between patients and the medical team, especially in a context where the volume of information received can be overwhelming. GoodSurgery aims to reduce the anxiety and uncertainty that often accompanies surgical procedures by providing a reliable source of information that the patient can consult at any time. It also facilitates patient adherence to medical recommendations, which contributes to better postoperative recovery and greater satisfaction with the process.
