## Project description:
This project consists of the development of an Android application to streamline the management of the Integrated Care Process (PAI) for skin cancer, using Firebase for real-time data management. The application facilitates instant communication between the patient and the dermatologist, improving treatment efficiency.

## What is AVI Health?
AVI Health is an application that allows patients to make dermatological consultations, schedule appointments, and manage teleconsultations with their doctors from an accessible and easy-to-use platform. In turn, doctors can manage consultations and respond to requests in real time, providing more efficient and closer patient care. All this is achieved by integrating Firebase as a backend platform for data storage and user management.

## Why was it created?
The main objective of this application is to improve patient care and decision making during the skin cancer treatment process. This type of cancer affects thousands of people, and waiting times for consultations and diagnoses can negatively affect treatment. With this tool, the aim is to streamline communication between doctors and patients by providing a platform to manage consultations and teleconsultations instantly, which is key in the e-Health era.
